    </div>
  );
};

export default ComponentName;
```
Replace `ComponentName` in the filename and code with a name that reflects the new component that you want to create.

## Add New Locations
![CoastSnap Locations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/venuswku/CoastSnap/main/src/images/README/LocationPage.gif)
1. Add the required location information in `locations.json`.
    - Example:
      ```json
      {
        "name": "Natural Bridges Site 1",
        "description": "This station has good exposure, solid reliable ground points, is interesting to look at on an image reel / time lapse and very car accessible.",
        "image": "NB1_21_01_27_16_48_Iphone11_IB.jpeg",
        "timelapseVids": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/akhXr-6nG5g"],
        "googleMapsLink": "https://goo.gl/maps/rzwiDPqygU3G2vQz8",
        "mapEmbedLink": "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d1005.7556443852632!2d-122.05724697064817!3d36.949501299999994!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x7bfc93095caca331!2zMzbCsDU2JzU4LjIiTiAxMjLCsDAzJzI0LjEiVw!5e1!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1650736198124!5m2!1sen!2sus"
      }
      ```
    - Use a comma to separate information about each location.
2. Create a new folder in `src/images` and name it with the location's `name` value from `locations.json`. Then place all images for this new location in the folder.
3. Add directions for the newly added location in `LocationDirection.js`:
    - Add the following into `LocationDirection.js`:
      ```html
      {loc === "Location Name" &&
        <div>
          <!-- Place directions and images here! -->
        </div>
      }
      ```
    - Replace `Location Name` with the name of the new location (must match the name in `location.json`).
    - Make sure to import any used images at the top of `LocationDirection.js`.
      - Example: `import NB1Lookout1 from "../images/Natural Bridges Site 1/NB1Pic1.jpg";`

## Add New Section to About Page
![About Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/venuswku/CoastSnap/main/src/images/README/AboutPage.gif)
1. Each section requires an illustration/image. Rename the new section's illustration/image file with a number.
    - This number will be used to determine where the new illustration/image will be placed relative to other existing illustrations/images.
2. Place the renamed illustration file in the `src/images/CoastSnap in Santa Cruz` folder.
3. The mobile layout of the About page is different than the desktop layout. If you have a specific illustration/image for the mobile layout, then repeat step 1 by renaming that illustration/image with the same number and placing it into the `src/images/CoastSnap in Santa Cruz/mobile` folder. Otherwise, add a copy of the desktop illustration/image into the `src/images/CoastSnap in Santa Cruz/mobile` folder.
3. Open the `coastsnapInSantaCruz.json` file located in the `src/data` folder.
4. Paste and modify the following template in order to add text for the new section in the `CoastSnapInSantaCruz` component.
    - Make sure to paste the template in the order that you would like the new section to appear on the About page.
      - Example: If you renamed the new section's illustration to `5` and there are 4 existing sections, then place the text template at the end of the list in `coastsnapInSantaCruz.json`. There should be 4 of these structured templates above our new template.
    ```json
    {
      "title": "Section Title",
      "text": "This is text that talks about the section title in more depth. You can bring attention to certain keywords by placing <span className=\"blueText\">and some important text in between these span tags</span> to bold the text with a <span className=\"blueText\">blue color</span>.",
      "button": ["https://www.websitelink.com/", "Text on Button that Leads to the Specified Website When Clicked"],
      "image": "Alternative Text that Appears When the Image Cannot Load"
    },
    ```
    - The `button` and `image` properties above are optional in case you don't have any resources/links to add.

## Add New Team Member to Homepage
1. Open the `teamMembers.json` file located in the `src/data` folder.
2. Paste the following template after the last teammate's info.
    - If you have an image of the new team member,
      - crop the image into a square shape for the best results
      - rename the image to the new team member's first and last name (without spaces in between)
      - place the image in the `src/images/UCSC Team` folder
      - replace `FirstLast.jpg` with the name of the image and the image format (e.g. `.jpg`, `.png`):
      ```json
      {
        "name": "First Last",
        "image": "FirstLast.jpg",
        "role": "New Team Member's Role(s)",
        "education": "Type of Degree in Major, Graduation Year"
      }
      ```
    - If you don't have an image of the new team member, then provide their initials instead:
      ```json
      {
        "name": "First Last",
        "initials": "FL",
        "role": "New Team Member's Role(s)",
        "education": "Type of Degree in Major, Graduation Year"
      }
      ```
    - Look at other team members' info for examples.
    - Note: Remember to add a comma `,` after the last teammate's info to separate the new teammate's info from theirs.
3. If the new team member has a LinkedIn profile or personal website that they would like to share, then add the following property and replace the placeholder link with their preferred link:
    ```json
    "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/username"
    ```
    - Note: Remember to add a comma `,` after the new teammate's `education` property to separate it from the `link` property.

## Add New Section/Link to Footer
- To add a new section to the footer, copy the following and add it to the object in `data/footer.json`:
  ```json
  "New Section Name": {
    <!-- Place section links here. -->
  }
  ```
- To add a new link under a section, choose a section to add the link to and paste the following underneath the section:
  ```json
  "Link Name": "https://www.link.com"
  ```
  - Replace the above with actual link values.
- Example (to create a new section and add two new links under it):
  ```json
  "New Section Name": {
    "Link Name 1": "https://www.link1.com",
    "Link Name 2": "https://www.link2.com"
  }
  ```

## Get a Local Copy of Repository to Modify Website
1. Open a terminal and navigate to a place where you want to store the CoastSnap repository.
2. Run in the terminal: `git clone https://github.com/venuswku/CoastSnap.git`.
3. Email vwku@ucsc.edu or venuswku@gmail.com to get the `.env` file, which contains the environment variables needed to access the Google Drive API. Save the `.env` file at the root of the repository (i.e. same level as the `App.js` and `package.json` files).
4. Run `npm ci` to locally install all package dependencies found in `package-lock.json`.
5. Run the website in development mode with **`npm start`**. Use `ctrl + C` or `cmd + C` to stop it from running.

Once the repository is copied to your local device, you just need to repeat step 5 to see your changes.

## Save Your Website Changes to GitHub
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the CoastSnap repository (e.g. `cd coastsnap`).
2. Run `git add .` to stage or mark the files that you want to save changes for.
    - Note: `.` stages all files that you have made a change on. You can also just replace `.` with a list of file names, separated with a space, to stage specific files (e.g. `git add Home.js LocationInfo.js`).
3. Run `git commit -m "Commit message"` and replace `Commit message` with a brief summary of the changes you made.
4. Run `git push` to push your changes for everyone to see on [GitHub](https://github.com/venuswku/CoastSnap).

## Publish Your Website Changes on UCSC Server
You need to deploy the website so that anyone who visits our [CoastSnap website](https://coastsnap.ucsc.edu/) would see your changes.
1. Build a production version of the website [based on your operating system](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45300532).
    - Open a terminal and navigate to the CoastSnap repository (e.g. `cd coastsnap`).
    - If you have a Windows operating system, execute `npm run build-windows` in the terminal.
    - If you have a Mac operating system, execute `npm run build-mac` in the terminal.
    - New production files should be saved into a `build` folder.\
  ![Production Build](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/venuswku/CoastSnap/main/src/images/README/ProductionBuild.PNG)
2. Deploy through UCSC's server by following [IT's instructions](https://its.ucsc.edu/web/hosting/hosted-pages-tutorial.html).
    - Connect to the UCSC server with the SFTP software of your choice (e.g. FileZilla, WinSCP).
      - Hostname: sftp.ic.ucsc.edu
      - Username: Your UCSC Cruz ID
      - Port Number: 22
      - Authentication Method: Your UCSC Blue Password
    - Open the directory where we'll store the website files: `/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/www/coastsnap/prod/public_html`.
    - Copy website files from this directory's `build` folder into the directory that we recently navigated to.
      - Overwrite previous files if they exist.\
  ![Transfer Production Build to UCSC Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/venuswku/CoastSnap/main/src/images/README/TransferBuildToUCSCServer.gif)
3. View deployed changes at https://coastsnap.ucsc.edu/.

## Learn More
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).\
To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**\
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.\
